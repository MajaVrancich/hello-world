# hello-world
My first task :)

So... My task is to introduce myself... Hmm, not so easy but ok, let's begin.
Hi everyone, I'm Maja and i come from Rijeka (Fiume), Croatia. 
I'm research and teaching assistant in Department of Informatics, University of Rijeka (from fall 2018.) Previously I worked for cca 6 years in several schools (mostly high schools) teaching informatics and etics.
From 2007 i'm in alpinism (summer, winter, all the good stuf) and I sometimes hike, run, ride bike, sea kayak. 

This should be enough for now :)

P.S. Pozdrav Vedrane, vjerujem da ćeš me stalkat :P
